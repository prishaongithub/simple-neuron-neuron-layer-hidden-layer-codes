# simple-neuron-neuron-layer-hidden-layer-codes
Building neural networks from scratch using Python and NumPy. This repo explains everything step-by-step—from a single neuron to layers, hidden layers, activation functions, forward propagation, loss, and backpropagation. No ML frameworks. Perfect for learning how neural networks actually work underneath.
