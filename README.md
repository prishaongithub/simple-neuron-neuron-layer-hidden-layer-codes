#🚀 Neural Networks From Scratch — Step by Step

This project builds a neural network from zero, starting with the simplest computational unit: a single neuron.
Each stage is implemented in clean, readable Python code and explained in detail for clarity.

**This repository contains an educational, minimal, and fully transparent implementation of neural networks from scratch using Python and Numpy. The code evolves gradually from a single neuron to multiple neurons, full layers, hidden layers, and ultimately a complete feed-forward neural network with backpropagation.

Designed for students, developers, and anyone who wants to understand how neural networks actually work behind the scenes—without relying on frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.**

📍 Goal of the Project

✔ Understand every mathematical step involved in neural networks
✔ Implement everything manually—no machine-learning frameworks
✔ Build intuition instead of blindly using libraries

🛠 Tech Stack

Python
NumPy

🎯 Future Plans

Add support for classification datasets

Implement Softmax + Cross Entropy

Add mini-batch training

Build a small image classifier (MNIST)
